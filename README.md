# weld-se-stackoverflow

Minimal reproducible example for my StackOverflow question at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30255760/unresolved-inject-depencendies-when-using-weld-se.

Comes with Gradle wrapper included, just build and run demo application using one of the following Gradle invocation:

    # Windows
    gradlew.bat run
  
    # Linux/Mac OS
    ./gradlew run
